    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option's and you choose one of these. After you make your choice you get a newset of option's; just what set of option you get depends upon what choice you made. this procedure repeated over and over until you reach the final state.If you make a good sequence of choice , your final state is a goal state;if you don't it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of the tree;the tree have some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that
    the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get a good leaf . At each node, beginning with the root you choose one of its 
    children to moves to ,and you keeps this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf you can backtrack to continue to a search for a good leaf by revocking your most recent choice, and trying out the next in that set of option </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <!--Image 1-->
    <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="this is a image" width="200" height="200"/>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options areA and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B,your options are E and F. Try E</li>
        <li>E is good Congratulations</li>
    </ol>
    <!--NOTE1-->
    <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possiblesequence of choice we could
       make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we
       we have.(If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
    </p>
    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
      if n is a leaf node {
        if the leaf is a goal node,return true
        else return false
      } else {
        for each child c of n {
          if solve(c) succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
       }
      }
    </pre>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 229, 229)">Notice that the algorithm is expressed asa boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If
     solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to
    some goal node . We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
    <h4>How does it solve</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>if any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>if no child of n is solvable, the n is not solveable. </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 229, 229)">Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solveable(part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any
        child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, t his is done by the lines</p>
        <pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
            for each child c of n {
                ifsolve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        </pre>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of starting it is as follows:</p>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To search a tree :</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, search the subtree untill you find one containing a goal node, or untill you have
        searched them all unsucessfully.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p>Backtracking is a rather recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, 
      that is how your recursive algorithmare translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>
    <pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
      boolean solve(Node n) {
        put node n on the stack;
        while the stack is not empty {
          if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
            if it is a goal node,return true
            else pop it off the stack
          } 
          else {
            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
               push the next untried child onto the stack
            else pop the node off the stack  
          }
          return false
        } 
      </pre>
    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the 
      stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the 
      tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
      if the rootnode gets removed(making the stack empty), there must have beenno goalnodes at all, and no solution to the problrm.
    </p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal 
      node.</p>
      <p>Similar, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of
        recursive calls. Thus the recursion unwinds, the path can recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) prinring the Nodeat the current level, or storing it in an array. 
      </p>
      <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>
      <pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
         boolean solve(Node n){
          if n is a node {
            if the leaf is a goal node {
              print n
              return true 
            }
            else return false
          } else {
            for each child c of n{
              if solve(c) succeeds {
                print n
                return true
              }
            }
            return false
          }
         }
      </pre>
      <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
      <p>All of these versions of backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty 
        cluttered up with detais. Even determining whether thenode is a leaf can be complex:
      </p>
      <p>for example, if the path represents a seriesof moves ina chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions</p>
      <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could tests
        whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it <b>isLeaf</b>). This method would encapsulate all the
        ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
      </p>
      <p>Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have 
        been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b>for each child
        c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obivous way to step through 
        them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can
        represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track
        of which ones you've already examined?</p>
       <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the 
        node (that is, when you first get there from above),make a list of all its children.As you try each child, take off the list. When 
        the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple approach, but it may require
        quite a lot of additional work 
       </p>
       <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an
        ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which to try next.
       </p>
       <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried
      <b>child K, </b>you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> Or, if you
    are trying to color amap with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails,
  you know to try child green next. If you are searching a  maze, you can try choices in the order left,straight,right <b>(or perhaps
    north,east,south,west).</b>
  </p>
  <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your
  pieces (or perhaps the square of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each pieces may also have several
moves, and these must also be ordered</p>
<h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
<p>For starter, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the
  simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
</p>
<p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One nodes is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point 
  to) zero,one,or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the  left child and/or the right child.
All nodes are reachable (by oneor more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not 
part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The
first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree</p>
<p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">public class BinaryTree{
   BinaryTree leftChild=null;
   BinaryTree rightChild=null;
   boolean isGoalNode=false;
   String name;

   BinaryTree(String name,BinaryTree left,BinaryTree right,boolean isGoalNode) {
    this.name=name;
    leftChild=left;
    rightChild=right;
    this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
   }
 }
</pre>
<p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and init we will define a method makeTre() which constructs the above binary tree:</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">static BinaryTree makeTree(){
   BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
   c = new BinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
   d = new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
   e = new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
   f = new BinaryTree("F",null,null,false);
   a = new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
   b = new BinaryTree("B",e,f,false);
   root = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
   return root;
} 
</pre>
<p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  public static void main(String args[]) {
     BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
     System.out.println(solable(tree));
  }
</pre>
<p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  static boolean solveable(BinaryTree node) {
    /* 1 */ if (node ==null) return false;
    /* 2 */ if(node.isGoalNode) return true;
    /* 3 */ if(solveable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    /* 4 */ if(solveable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    /* 5 */ return false; 

  }
</pre>
<p>Here's what the numbered lines are along:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solveable. This is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
  first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
  <li>if the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
  <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, ad if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null
    and is not a goal node, says to
  </li>
  <li>Do thesame thingfor the right child</li>
  <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solveable. </li>
</ol>
<p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
<p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
  alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative versions</p>
  <pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">static boolean solvable(BinaryTree) {
    if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
    if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    return false;

  }
  </pre>
  <p>I think first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
  <hr style="border-color:  rgb(232, 229, 229) ">
  <!--What are children-->
  <h1>What are the children?</h1>
  <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous
    choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the
    right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may beable to eliminates children immediately, without
    recursion.
  </p>
  <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
    how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are thesamw color.
  </p>
  <p>
    To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, untill all countries are
    colored. 
  </p>
  <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at agoal node.</li>
    <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of
      countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's apply each of these two method to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkboard only needs two colors.</p>
  <p><b>boolean mapls()</b><br/>
    Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
  <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b>
  Used by method 2to check, at every node, whether there isan adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>
  <p><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row,int column)</b><br>/
  Used by both methods to find next "country"(actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkboard).</p> 
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  boolean explore1(int row, int column,int color) {
    if(row >=NUM_ROWS)return maplsOK();
    map[row][column] = color;
    for (int nextColor =RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++){
      int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
      if(explore1(next[0],nextColor)) return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
</pre>
<p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
<pre  style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color){
    if (row > = NUM_ROW)return true;
    if (okToColor(row,column,color)){
      map[row][column]=color;
      for (int nextColor = RED;nextColor < = BLUE; nextColor++){
        int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
        if(explore2(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
      }
    } 
    return false
  }
</pre>
<p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests Otherwise:</p>
<center><table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td style="background-color: grey">2 by 3 map</td>
    <td style="background-color: grey">3 by 3 map</td>
    <td style="background-color: grey">3 by 4 map</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: grey">Method 1:</td>
    <td>60 ms.</td>
    <td>940 ms.</td>
    <td>60530 ms. (1minute)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: grey;">Method 2:</td>
    <td>0ms.</td>
    <td>0 ms.</td>
    <td>0 ms.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>The zero in the above table indicate times too short to mesure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of 
  these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will
  often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until aleaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically 
  guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the setof choices), do so!
</p>

<!--Debugging-->
<h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
<p>often our first try at a program does't work, and weneed to debug it.Debuggers are helpful, but sometimeswe needs to finally
  back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be
applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines. </p>
<!--trick1-->
<p><b>Trick#1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b></p>
<p>often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably
  want to print, for each method, what parameter it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long
list of these, it's hard to match up method exist with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help. </p>
<!--trick2-->
<p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print method for debugging.</b></p>
<p>Don't clutter up your actual code than you must. Also,remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself
  contains bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very carefull with it.
</p>
<p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs
  the proportions will be better.
</p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  static String indent = "";

  static storing name(BinaryTree node){
    if (node == null) return null;
    else return node.name;

  }
  static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solveable("+name(node)+")");
    indent = indent + "";

  }

  static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
    indent = indent.substring(3);
    System.out.println(indent + "solveable(" + name(node)+") return true;
    return true;
  }

  static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
    indent = indent.substring(3);
    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");
    return false;
  }
</pre>
<p>To use this code, we modify solveable as follows:</p>
<pre  style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  static boolean solveable(BinaryTree node){
    enter(node);
    if(node == null) return no(node);
    if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
    if (solveable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
    if (solveable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
    return no(node);
  }
</pre>
<p>And we get these results:</p>
<pre>
  Entering solvable(Root)
   Entering solvable(A)
    Entering solvable(c);
     Entering solvable(null)
      solvable(null) returns false
      solvable(C) returns false
    Entering solvable(D)
     Entering solvable(null)
     solvable(null) returns false
    solvable(D) return false
   solvable(A) returns false
  Entering solvable(B)
   Entering solvable(E)
   solvable(B) return true
  solvable(Root) return true
  true
</pre>
<br/>
<p><b>Trick #3: Never discards your debugging statements.</b></p>
<p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statementsas it is to debug
 the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw thiscode away?</p>
 <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit(or to turn over to
  your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, ut that can bea lot of work. What's more, in the above example,
  you would haveto replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these 
  changes, you might introduce new bugsinto your program. 
 </p>
 <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
 <pre  style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  static final boolean debugging = false;

  static void enter(BinaryTree node){
    if(debugging){
      System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable("+ name(node) + ")");
      indent = indent + " ";
    }
  }

  static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
    if(debugging) {
      indent = indent.substring(3);
      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
    }
    return true;
  }

  static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
    if(debugging){
      indent = indent.substring(3);
      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");
    }
    return false;
  }
 </pre>
 <p>In industry, actual program often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about 
  making your code large; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debuggings is final, it can never be true, and the
controlled code will be discarded.</p>
<!--trick 4-->
<p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p>
<p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
  printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object likeany other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
  However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following

<h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
<p>I call the following puzzie "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marblesand the same number
  of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with 
  the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marble all at the other end, and a free space in between.

  <p><b>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move,a
    marble can either:
  </b></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
    <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:</p>

  <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and return a boolean. In solvablewe shall need to check whether we are a leaf,
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
  </p>
  <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the
    puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to  
 print out the bad news.</p>
 <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and return a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
  which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. 
 </p>
 <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board
  position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.
  Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
 </p>
 <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of
  approaches would work, and follows is based on the way i worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find
  a different but equally valid approach.
 </p>
 <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. if it can jump,
  it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find  the possible moves, we might assign number to the marbles,and
  check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require 
  having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or less somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the
  board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>
  <p>Next, notice that for a given board position,each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about movinga 
    particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then That 
    must be the only move possible from that space,because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight
    complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the space (unlike the marbles) in one place.
  </p>
  <p><b>Now wehave a simpler ordering of moves to usein our program.Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each
    spaces, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int
    position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
  </b></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>if the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
    <li>if the position contain a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
    <li>if the position contain a white marble, themethod checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b>that will take a board and a position, make a move form
  that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,
rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concered with simplicity.) In technically jargon, makeMove is "applicative"
rather than "mutative".</p>
<p>Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b>we are using methods<b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b>with meaning That
should be obivous. </p>
<pre style="color:blue;border:1px solid rgb(232, 229, 229);border-radius:5px">
  boolean solvable(int[] board) {
    if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE;position++) {
    if (canMove(board,position)) {
      int[] newBord = makeMove(board,position);
      if(solvable(newBoard)) {
        printBoard(newBord);
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
</pre>
<p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meaning that should be obivous.</p>
<p>Here is some output from the program;</p>
<!--list -->
  <ol type="number" start="16" reversed>
    <li><b>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></li> 
    <li><b>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>_____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</b></li>
    <li><b>BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the least
    line. i've added line number to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces it 
    results (sequence
     of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get
     them in the correct order.
